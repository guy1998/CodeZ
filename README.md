# CodeZ
CodeZ Program Version 1.0 06/17/2022

GENERAL USAGE NOTES:
--------------------
-This game allows the user to play and learn coding at the same time. The user has to go through the level 
and then at the end of the level, he has to solve a programming question in python.
-Be aware that the program does not let you know where the mistake is in your code is, so you have to try until 
you get it right. However, you are able to take hints or use the already prepared structures for the code.

Installing under Windows
--------------------------
When you want to intall the game, it is necessary to install Python.
You can download Python by clicking on the link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and choosing the latest version for Windows. 
Make sure choose the path option when installing.
It is recommanded to use pycharm, a smart code editor to run the code. You can download pycharm in the provided link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/.
However if your computer does not support the community edition of pycharm you can use any other editor available such as IDLE or PyScripter.
Please avoid the use of an online editor such as Replit because not all the features will be available and the performance of the system will be undermined.

Further detalis on how to run the game in the next section.

Making the game work
---------------------
Firstly you have to extract the folder with the name CodeZ from the zip file. Then you have to install pygame module. This is done by opening the command prompt
and typing "pip install pygame". After doing this depending on the editor you have choosen you will have to open the CodeZ folder as 
a project. We strongly recommend using pycharm for this process. In this platform you have to go to file and then click on open. Navigate through the folders in 
your computer and select CodeZ folder. Once you have done this choose "open" and then "trust project". Before you run the game make sure to add pygame to this 
project. To do this follow these steps: go to "file" -> select "settings"-> go to "project" -> python interpreter -> click the "plus" button at top left of the box
-> type pygame and then click on "install package". Depending on the previous project you have done in pycharm pygame might be already implemented so you can skip this step.
However, it is recommended to check it anyway. Make sure that all the files stay on the repository and are not altered or deleted. Since the project is under
development there are extra files in there. However, DO NOT attempt to delete any of this files since the information might be interconnected and such refactoring
might result in errors. The file that should be executed is the "main.py" file. For insturction on how to make the game run in other platforms or if you are having 
difficulty understanding the process of running the game in pycharm please contact one of the emails provided at the end of this file. Enjoy the game!
